<p align="center"><strong> Partially Automated File/URL Scanner</strong></p>

### You may ask, which is the automated part?
The automated section is:

*- It is Ai-based analysis summary via Mistral. So, it is automated summarization and interpretation.

*- It is combining and formatting results for final output. It is also automated and retured via API.

### What is not fully automated:

*_ It does not scan URLs or files automatically, so the user has to access the FastAPI link to upload a file or a link.

*_ There is no scheduled or background scanning. Therefore, all actions are initiated manually by the user.

### If you woud like to provide suggestion for my practice and learning, I would appreciate it.
