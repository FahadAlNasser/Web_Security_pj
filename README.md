<p align="center"><strong> Web Security File/URL Scanner using VirusTotal</strong></p>

### Information

This is another separate branch from the main branch, reimplemented to rely on the Flask package. This project is not automated. If you want to automate it, you will need to modify the code to:

1- Allowing to run in the background continously
2- Allowing it to scan URLs or files automatically
3- Allowing to store the scan results in a specific folder or database
4- Enabling it to optionally take actions. For example, blocking malicious URLs or preventing file downloads

With these aspects, the project would fucntion like an antivirus system. 

### Information about the main branch

The main branch includes AI model administration. With further tweaking, it could also be extended to support automation. I have not worked on the automation project here, as my goal is to practice and explore frameworks and libraries.

In order to build a fully automated system, a more robust framework like Django would be more suitable especially for big project to implement automation and other packages for security.
